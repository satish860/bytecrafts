Feel free to modify the prompts and try out your own variations.</p>\n<h2>Example 1: Simple Question Prompt</h2>\n<p>Human: What is the capital of France?</p>\n<p>Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.</p>\n<p>Try it yourself and see how Claude responds to a straightforward question!</p>\n<h2>Example 2: Open-Ended Prompt</h2>\n<p>Human: Tell me about the history of the Eiffel Tower.</p>\n<p>Assistant: The Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark in Paris, France. It was designed and built by Gustave Eiffel's company as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair.</p>\n<p>Construction began in January 1887 and was completed in March 1889. The tower is 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for 41 years until the Chrysler Building was built in 1930.</p>\n<p>Initially, the Eiffel Tower was met with criticism from the public, with many calling it an eyesore. However, it soon became a cultural icon of France and a symbol of Paris.</p>\n<p>The tower was originally intended to stand for only 20 years, but it proved valuable for communication purposes so it was allowed to remain after the permit expired. It has since become one of the most recognizable structures in the world, attracting millions of visitors each year.</p>\n<h3>Key Milestones in the Eiffel Tower's History</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1889 - Opened for the World's Fair</li>\n<li>1900 - Used as a radio tower to dispatch Parisian taxis to the front line during the Battle of the Marne</li>\n<li>1930 - Surpassed as the tallest structure in the world by the Chrysler Building</li>\n<li>1940-1944 - Closed during the German occupation of Paris in WWII</li>\n<li>1957 - Records 6 million visitors</li>\n<li>1980s - Undergoes major renovations</li>\n<li>2000 - Reaches 200 million visitors since its opening</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Today, the Eiffel Tower remains a must-see attraction and continues to be an internationally recognized symbol of Paris and France. Its unique silhouette, glittering lights, and stunning views from the top make it beloved by people around the world.</p>\n<p>Experiment with an open-ended prompt and observe how Claude provides a detailed response!</p>\n<h2>Example 3: A Prompt with Very Minimal Context</h2>\n<p>Human: Tell me a story.</p>\n<p>Assistant: Here is a short story for you:</p>\n<h3>The Hidden Treasure</h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a young girl named Lila. She had always been fascinated by the legends of a hidden treasure buried deep within the nearby forest.</p>\n<h4>The Adventure Begins</h4>\n<p>One day, driven by curiosity, Lila ventured into the woods, determined to uncover the truth behind the tales. As she wandered deeper, the trees seemed to whisper secrets, guiding her path.</p>\n<h4>A Mysterious Discovery</h4>\n<p>Suddenly, she stumbled upon an ancient oak tree, its trunk adorned with peculiar markings. Lila traced her fingers over the symbols, and to her surprise, a hidden door creaked open, revealing a narrow passage.</p>\n<h4>The Underground Chamber</h4>\n<p>With a pounding heart, she stepped inside, descending into an underground chamber. There, bathed in a mysterious glow, lay a small, ornate chest. Lila approached it cautiously and lifted the lid, revealing not gold or jewels, but a single, weathered scroll.</p>\n<h4>The True Treasure</h4>\n<p>Unrolling the parchment, Lila read the words: \"True treasure lies not in riches, but in the adventures, friendships, and wisdom gained along the way.\"</p>\n<h4>A Life Changed Forever</h4>\n<p>With a smile, she realized that her journey itself had been the real treasure. Lila emerged from the forest, forever changed by the profound truth she had discovered.</p>\n<p>From that day forward, Lila embraced life's adventures, cherishing the experiences and connections she made. And though she never found material wealth, she lived a life rich in love, laughter, and the true treasures of the heart.</p>\n<p>See how Claude can generate a creative story even with minimal context in the prompt!</p>\n<h2>Example 4: Provide Your Own Prompt</h2>\n<p>Human: [Enter your own basic prompt here]</p>\n<p>Assistant: [Claude will respond to your prompt. Analyze the response - does it satisfy what you were looking for? If not, try modifying the prompt to be more clear and specific.]</p>\n<p>Now it's your turn - provide your own prompt and see how Claude responds!</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This playground provides a few examples of basic prompt structures to experiment with. The key is to think about what type of response you want from Claude (a specific fact, an open-ended explanation, a story, etc.) and then craft your prompt accordingly, providing appropriate context and instructions.</p>\n<p>In the next lessons, we'll dive deeper into techniques for making prompts clear and direct to get higher quality responses from Claude. But for now, play around with these basic examples to get a feel for how changing the prompt impacts Claude's output.</p>",
